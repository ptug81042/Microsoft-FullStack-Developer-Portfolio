# Step 3: Combining Loops and If-Else to Determine Pass or Fail
Write a program that uses a for loop with an if-else structure to check if each student's score meets the passing criteria. A student passes if their score is 50 or above. <br>
Instructions:
1. Define an array named studentScores containing the integers 45, 60, 72, 38, and 55.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array.
3. Inside the loop, use an if-else statement to check if the score is 50 or above.
4. Print "Pass" if the score is 50 or above; otherwise, print "Fail."
