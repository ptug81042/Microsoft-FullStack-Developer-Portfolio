# Step 1: Using a For Loop to Calculate Total Scores
You are developing a program for a quiz system to calculate the total score of a student based on individual quiz scores. The scores are stored in an array, and you need to use a for loop to sum them up. <br>
Instructions:
1. Define an array named scores containing the integers 85, 90, 78, 92, and 88.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array and calculate the total score.
3. Print the total score using Console.WriteLine().
