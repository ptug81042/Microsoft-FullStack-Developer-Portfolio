# Step 2: Switch Statement for Travel Mode Selection
The travel company offers multiple travel modes: "Bus," "Train," and "Flight." Each mode has a different booking message. Create a program using a switch statement to determine which mode of transportation the user selects. <br>
Steps:
1. Declare a string variable string mode to store the user's travel mode.
2. Prompt the user to select a mode using Console.WriteLine and capture the input using Console.ReadLine().
3. Use a switch statement to determine which message to print:
   * If the user selects "Bus," print "Booking a bus ticket."
   * If the user selects "Train," print "Booking a train ticket."
   * If the user selects "Flight," print "Booking a flight ticket."
   * Include a default case for invalid inputs with the message "Invalid selection. Please choose Bus, Train, or Flight."
