# Step 4: Combining Loops and Switch Statements for Task Scheduling
Create a program that schedules weekly tasks using a switch statement inside a for loop to assign a task for each day. <br>
Instructions:
1. Define an array named weekDays containing the strings "Monday," "Tuesday," "Wednesday," "Thursday," "Friday."
2. Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array.
3. Inside the loop, use a switch statement to assign a task to each day:
   * If it's "Monday," print "Team Meeting."
   * If it's "Tuesday," print "Code Review."
   * If it's "Wednesday," print "Development."
   * If it's "Thursday," print "Testing."
   * If it's "Friday," print "Deployment."
